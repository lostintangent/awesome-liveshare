## Editor Extensions

While Visual Studio Live Share provides a rich collaborative experience out-of-the-box (e.g. editing, debugging, terminals, localhost servers), it's also fully [extensible](#exensibility-sdks), which enables 3<sup>rd</sup> party extensions to augment it in new and interesting ways.
